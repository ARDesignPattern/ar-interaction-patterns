# Point of Interest Guide

**Problem**  
Visitors in AR-enhanced environments such as museums or exhibitions may struggle to efficiently locate points of interest (PoIs). Without clear directional guidance, they risk missing key exhibits due to complex spatial layouts, limited time, or inadequate physical signage.

**Context**  
This pattern is suitable for AR spaces containing multiple PoIs, such as museums, galleries, or trade shows. It is especially valuable when:
- Visitors have limited time and need to prioritize key content.
- The venue is large or subdivided, making it hard to identify or reach a specific exhibit.
- Conventional maps or signage are insufficient or difficult to interpret.

**Use When**
- Visitors begin exploration and seek their first AR destination.
- Visitors want to locate unvisited exhibits efficiently.
- Visitors wish to revisit previously explored exhibits.
- Time constraints require targeted navigation.

**Solution**  
To assist users in reaching PoIs effectively, combine spatial guidance, interface support, and multisensory feedback:

- **Path Point-Based Guiding Method**  
  Generate or author a guiding path from the user’s current or starting position to a selected PoI. Insert path nodes (waypoints) at critical decision points (e.g., corners, junctions) to create a continuous and intuitive route.

- **Point of Interest Selection Interface**  
  Provide a user interface (e.g., hand-held menu, gaze-triggered selection, or voice command) allowing visitors to choose PoIs based on personal interest, route efficiency, or time availability.

- **Navigation Control Interface**  
  Include options for users to start, pause, resume, or stop guidance as needed.

- **Directional Visual Cues**  
  Overlay visual indicators (e.g., arrows, animated trails, footprints) in AR space, guiding the user step by step along the path.

- **Auditory Feedback**  
  Reinforce the direction through audio cues—e.g., spatial sounds or spoken hints—especially near intersections or exhibit entrances.

- **Arrival Trigger**  
  Present a clear signal (e.g., a sound or visual flare) confirming successful arrival at the destination.

**Notes**  
This pattern enhances orientation and engagement in AR-rich spaces by reducing spatial confusion and supporting personalized exhibit discovery.
