# Sequential Explanation

## Problem
Visitors often struggle with understanding the various categories of information in an exhibit and may find it challenging to explore the exhibit at their own pace.

## Context
Exhibits typically encompass multiple information categories or numerous information pieces. Visitors require a structured approach to explore digital knowledge in a logical and comfortable sequence.

## Use When

- Visitors have activated the virtual information feature of an exhibit.
- Visitors seek a comprehensive and self-paced learning experience about the exhibit.

## Solution

- Exhibit Information Categorization: Organize the exhibit information into distinct categories. Provide a button for each category, allowing users to easily access specific information.
- Detailed Exhibit Explanation: Sequentially present exhibit information from each category, highlighting specific components for visualizing abstract data. Provide aligned audio descriptions for each visual element.
- Navigation Controls: Include 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons, enabling visitors to control the progression of their tour according to their preference.
- Category Indicators: Display the title of each information category prominently to inform visitors of their current focus area.
- Control for Animated Content: For exhibits with animated or video content, provide 'Pause' and 'Resume' buttons, allowing users to control the viewing experience.
