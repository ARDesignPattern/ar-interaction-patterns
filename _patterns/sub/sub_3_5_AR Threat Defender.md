# AR Threat Defender

## Problem
Invisible or abstract threats—such as pollution or climate impacts—are difficult to convey in static displays, reducing urgency and visitor empathy.

## Context
Ideal for natural-history and environmental exhibits where negative forces (e.g., ghost nets, acidic runoff) cannot be shown physically yet demand tangible representation.

## Use When

- The exhibit’s goal is to illustrate environmental hazards and empower visitors with mitigation strategies.

- Real-time gestural interaction is feasible in the installation space.

## Solution

**Gesture-Based Object Interception**

- Spawn harmful objects (e.g., drifting nets, plastic debris) that move toward vulnerable reef sections.

- Track visitor hand or body gestures to block, deflect, or capture these threats.

**Targeted Protection & Progressive Challenges**

- Emphasize critical reef zones by highlighting them whenever they are at risk.

- Increase difficulty through faster objects, multiple simultaneous threats, or visibility-reducing effects to sustain engagement.

**Start-Point Guidance with Animated Prompts**

- Introduce each threat via a brief cinematic illustrating its real-world origin and consequences.

- Provide on-screen arrows or ghost hands demonstrating the required protective gesture.

**Narration & Real-Time Feedback**

- Spatialized audio narrates impact statistics when threats are neutralized or missed.

- Visual effects (e.g., coral brightening, fish population bloom) reinforce successful defense actions.

**Educational Wrap-Up**

- After gameplay, display personalized metrics (e.g., objects intercepted, reef health score) along with actionable conservation tips visitors can adopt beyond the museum.

## Notes

By turning hazard mitigation into an embodied game, this pattern converts abstract ecological data into visceral experience, driving home the importance—and attainability—of environmental stewardship.
