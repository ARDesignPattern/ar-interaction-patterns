# AR Exhibit Reassembler

## Problem
When an exhibit showcases only partial physical artifacts, visitors struggle to grasp the exhibit’s full form and scale, hindering their understanding of how individual parts relate to the whole.

## Context
This pattern applies to museum pieces (e.g., fossils, machinery, architectural relics) where substantial elements are missing, yet digital reconstructions are available to complete the story.

## Use When

- Visitors encounter exhibits with missing components that must be virtually reconstructed.

- The goal is to deepen comprehension of an object’s overall structure and significance through active participation.

## Solution

**Jigsaw-Puzzle Reconstruction Mechanic**

- Spawn interactive 3-D pieces representing the absent parts.

- Require visitors to match shapes, edges, or textures to dock each piece in its correct position on the physical artifact.

**Progression Feedback**

- After every correct placement, provide immediate visual confirmation (e.g., glow animation) and an encouraging audio cue.

- Display a completion meter to motivate continued engagement.

**Adaptive Challenge Balancing**

- Begin with boundary or high-contrast pieces to build confidence.

- Gradually increase difficulty by introducing subtler matches or mirrored pieces based on user performance.

**Start-Point Guidance & Tutorial**

- Highlight an initial region of interest and launch a concise voice-over or on-screen guide explaining controls and objectives.

**Narrative Enhancements**

- As sections assemble, trigger contextual facts (e.g., bone function, historical discovery) to weave learning into the puzzle flow.

## Notes

This pattern transforms incomplete physical remains into a hands-on, completion-driven experience that reinforces structural understanding and sustains visitor motivation.
