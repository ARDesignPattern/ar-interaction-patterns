# AR Exhibit Feature Drawing

## Problem
Static presentations of speculative or partially unknown exhibit features limit visitor engagement and discourage creative interpretation.

## Context
Use in exhibits where scientific consensus is evolving (e.g., feather morphology of early dinosaurs, coloration of extinct species, architectural reconstructions).

## Use When

- The exhibit relies on hypothetical or contested visual details.

- The aim is to invite visitors to co-create or debate plausible interpretations.

## Solution

**Freehand & Pinch-Gesture Drawing**

- Provide a spatial canvas around or directly on the 3-D exhibit model.

- Let visitors sketch feathers, textures, or annotations using mid-air strokes and pinch gestures.

**Feature Customization Toolkit**

- Offer adjustable brush size, opacity, and palette options drawn from current scientific theories.

- Allow erasing or layering to refine ideas.

**Start-Point Guidance & Prompt Zones**

- Highlight recommended areas (e.g., wings, crest) to encourage exploration without overwhelming novices.

**Feedback & Comparative Overlay**

- Real-time visual feedback shows stroke accuracy and depth placement.

- A toggle reveals expert or consensus reconstructions so visitors can compare and reflect.

**Creative Interpretation Gallery**

- Upon finishing, save visitor designs to a shared gallery wall, cycling through community contributions and sparking discussion.

## Notes

This pattern elevates visitors from passive observers to active co-interpreters, fostering dialogue around uncertain scientific narratives and nurturing creative thinking.
