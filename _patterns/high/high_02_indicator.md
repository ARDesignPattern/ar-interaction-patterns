# AR Experience Indicator

## Problem
Visitors are often unaware of which exhibits contain embedded AR content or how to activate it. As a result, they may miss enriching experiences or waste time searching for interactive features without success.

## Context 
This pattern is used in exhibition environments where only a subset of the exhibits contains AR experiences. It assumes that:
- Visitors are equipped with an HMD or other AR interface;
- There are no clear visual or spatial cues indicating which exhibits are interactive.

## Use When
- Visitors are freely exploring and need explicit, discoverable cues for AR-enabled exhibits.
- Visitors reach a specific exhibit and want to activate rich multimedia or contextual content.

## Solution  
To help visitors easily identify and access AR content, combine clear visual cues with intuitive activation methods and feedback:

- **Visual Indicators**  
  Place recognizable AR prompts (such as floating 3D icons, glowing outlines, pulsing circles, or minimalist labels) near exhibits that offer digital interaction. These cues distinguish AR-enabled exhibits from non-interactive ones.

- **Activation Mechanism**  
  Enable users to launch the AR content through intuitive interactions, such as:
  - Gaze or gesture recognition zones;
  - Voice commands (e.g., “show me more”);
  - Virtual or spatial triggers (e.g., stepping into a glowing AR circle on the floor to start content playback).

- **Feedback Cues**  
  Once an exhibit is activated, provide immediate feedback confirming success:
  - Visually, via brief animations, interface changes, or highlight effects;
  - Audibly, using sound effects, tones, or spoken messages to indicate system response.

## Notes 
This pattern helps prevent missed opportunities for engagement by making AR content clearly discoverable and easily triggerable. It supports both first-time and returning visitors by offering consistent, recognizable AR interaction cues.
