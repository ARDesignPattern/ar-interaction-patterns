# Point of Interest Guide

## Problem
Visitors in AR-enhanced environments such as museums or exhibitions may struggle to efficiently locate points of interest (PoIs). Without clear directional guidance, they risk missing key exhibits due to complex spatial layouts, limited time, or inadequate physical signage.

## Context
This pattern is suitable for AR spaces containing multiple PoIs, such as museums, galleries, or trade shows. It is especially valuable when:

- Visitors have limited time and need to prioritize key content.
- The venue is large or subdivided, making it hard to identify or reach a specific exhibit.
- Conventional maps or signage are insufficient or difficult to interpret.

## Use When

- Visitors begin exploration and seek their first AR destination.
- Visitors want to locate unvisited exhibits efficiently.
- Visitors wish to revisit previously explored exhibits.
- Time constraints require targeted navigation.

## Solution

To assist users in reaching PoIs effectively, combine spatial guidance, interface support, and multisensory feedback:

- **Path Point-Based Guiding Method**  
  Generate or author a guiding path from the userâ€™s current or starting position to a selected PoI.

- **Point of Interest Selection Interface**  
  Provide a user interface for selecting PoIs by interest, efficiency, or time.

- **Navigation Control Interface**  
  Allow users to start, pause, resume, or stop guidance.

- **Directional Visual Cues**  
  Overlay visual indicators in AR space.

- **Auditory Feedback**  
  Use spatial sounds or voice guidance at key locations.

- **Arrival Trigger**  
  Provide visual/audio confirmation when the user reaches the PoI.

## Notes

This pattern enhances orientation and engagement in AR-rich spaces by reducing spatial confusion and supporting personalized exhibit discovery.
