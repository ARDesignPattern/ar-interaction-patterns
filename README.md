# Head-Mounted AR Interaction Design Pattern Library

This project presents a web-based template for showcasing a set of design patterns developed as part of my PhD research on augmented reality (AR) interaction design using head-mounted displays (HMDs). It is intended for researchers, designers, and developers interested in applying reusable interaction strategies to AR experiences, especially in cultural heritage and museum contexts.
