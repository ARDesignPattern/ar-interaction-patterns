  <p class="intro-text">
    This AR Pattern Library is part of a PhD research project that explores interaction design patterns for head-mounted display-based augmented reality experiences. It aims to support designers and developers working in cultural heritage, education, and beyond.

    The library provides high-level and reusable AR interaction solutions grounded in empirical studies and iterative prototyping. It also serves as a communication bridge between design researchers, developers, and cultural institutions.
