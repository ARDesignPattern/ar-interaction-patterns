# Threat Defender Pattern

**Intent:** Raise awareness of environmental threats by gamifying protection of exhibits.

**Scenario:** In a coral reef section, users identify and repel threats like pollution or invasive species using gestures or gaze-based shooting.

**Steps:**
1. Introduce threats in the scene
2. Allow interaction (e.g. tap, shoot, shield)
3. Reward correct actions
4. Visualize reef health status
