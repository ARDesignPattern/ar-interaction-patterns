      AR Interaction Design Patterns provide structured solutions to recurring challenges in augmented reality interaction design. By capturing best practices across domains such as user navigation, object manipulation, and spatial feedback, these patterns help designers and developers create intuitive, efficient, and context-aware AR experiences.
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Grounded in empirical research and iterative prototyping, AR interaction patterns serve as reusable design knowledge that supports the development of user-centered AR applications, particularly in complex environments like cultural heritage, education, and gaming.
