      <p class="intro-text">
        The <strong>Technology</strong> module presents the practical implementations of the interaction design patterns developed as part of my PhD research on head-mounted display (HMD)-based augmented reality in cultural heritage contexts.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        All interaction patterns showcased here were originally conceived, designed, and evaluated by me, with the goal of supporting developers in creating effective AR interaction experiences grounded in both usability and contextual relevance.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        To facilitate reuse and practical application, each pattern has been implemented as a Unity prefab, encapsulating its core interaction mechanisms. These prefabs are available for download and linked to corresponding GitHub repositories.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        The Unity scripting work was technically supported by <strong>Manuel Feller</strong>, a master’s student in computer science, who contributed to the implementation of selected interaction scripts under my supervision. All algorithms and interaction logic were defined and approved by me to ensure consistency with the theoretical framework of the research.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        This module complements the theoretical contributions of the dissertation by translating pattern-based design into ready-to-use, field-tested components suitable for integration into real-world AR applications.
